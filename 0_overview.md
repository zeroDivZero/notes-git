# OVERVIEW

Open-source distributed version control system. Small footprint, lightweight commands, performant.

Unix-like structure to allow gluing together series of small programs and using rich set of option switches to control behavior. Simple to use, powerful for experts needing precise control.

## Content-focused, not File

Precision at content level, not file. Can track code moving from one file to another.

## Opt-in, not Opt-out

Change must be explicitly staged to be committed. Less accidental check-ins.

## Efficient Network Transfer

Pleasant to use as distributed VCS.

Works offline; only small subset of commands (`push`, `pull`, etc.) deal with exchange of changes.
